BreakPointOnRegisterValue

    Will break if a register is set to a specific value
    Parameters: What register (Enum), What value (DWORD, Mask DWORD)

BreakPointOnRegisterChange

    Will break if a register is modified
    Parameters: What register (Enum)

All these breakpoints use singlestepping (either into or over).

The BreakPointOnFlag has a problem with returning an exact EIP. I could make it return
an exact EIP, but not at the exact EIP address.. So I rather have it on non-exact EIP
and have the real EIP be that.
